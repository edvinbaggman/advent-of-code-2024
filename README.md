# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written in TypeScript and executed using [Deno](https://deno.land).

Unfortunately, I only had time to do the first 14.

## Requirements

- Install [Deno](https://deno.land) on your machine.

## Usage

Place the input file for the specific day into the corresponding folder:

```bash
/day-[number]/input.txt
```

Use the following command to run the solution for a specific day:

```bash
deno -R [number].ts
```
